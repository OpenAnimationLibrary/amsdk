========================================================================
       MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : sample
========================================================================

This sample DLL has been created for you by the Class Wizard.  
The DLL demonstrates the basic use of the Microsoft Foundation Classes  
and serves as a starting point for creating your own DLLs.

This file contains a summary of all the components that make up your sample DLL.

sample.dsp  
    This file (the project file) contains project-level information and is used  
    to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the project  
    file (.dsp) but should export their makefiles locally.

sample.h  
    This is the main header file for the DLL, in which the class  
    `CSampleApp` is declared.

sample.cpp  
    This is the main source file for the DLL. It contains  
    the `CSampleApp` class.

sample.rc  
    This file is a listing of all Microsoft Windows resources used by the program.  
    It contains the icons, bitmaps, and cursors located in the `RES` subdirectory.  
    This file can be directly edited within Microsoft Visual C++.

sample.clw  
    This file contains information used by the Class Wizard to edit existing  
    classes or add new ones. The Class Wizard also uses this file to store  
    information needed to build and edit message maps and dialog data maps,  
    and to create prototype member functions.

res\sample.rc2  
    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft Visual C++.  
    Any resources that cannot be edited by the Resource Editor should be  
    placed in this file.

sample.def  
    This file contains information about the DLL required for execution  
    under Microsoft Windows. It defines parameters such as the name and  
    description of the DLL, as well as the functions exported by the DLL.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp  
    These files are used to create precompiled header files (`sample.pch`)  
    and a precompiled type file (`StdAfx.obj`).

Resource.h  
    This is the standard header file that defines new resource IDs.  
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file automatically.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Additional notes:

The Class Wizard inserts "TODO:" in the source code to indicate  
places where you can add or modify functionality.
